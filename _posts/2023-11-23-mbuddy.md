## What is Mbuddy?

Mbuddy is a command-line serial monitor that I wrote to better communicate with 
my embedded systems projects. While there are certainly plenty of programs to 
monitor serial port data, there weren't as many programs available to *send* 
data to the serial port. To complicate things further, I found myself increasingly
utilizing the command-line and WSL for my programming. I wanted a solution that 
I could use from the command line easily without switching between several
programs during development. Thus, mbuddy was born. I used the ncurses library 
to create a TUI (text user interface) that would allow me to easily change
serial ports or baud rates without exiting the program. 

Since I have the most experience writing code in C, it was a natural choice to
use for this project as well. Luckily, linux distros provide ample documentation
for development. Unluckily, the ncurses library started eons ago, which means
that it has several quirks as remnants of it's long history. After a couple of
weeks, I had v1.0 up and running, which is what you see here.

Right now mbuddy only runs natively on linux, but I have some lofty plans to
port it to Windows in the future. It's pretty low priority as I work on my other
projects, but I see it as a nice challenge.
